# Cryptocurrencies

In this analysis , we created a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system.
The data had to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output ,we decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we used   a clustering algorithm. Also, we used data visualizations to share the findings.

# This project consists of four technical analysis deliverables:

* Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
* Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
* Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
* Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
